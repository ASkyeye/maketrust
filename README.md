# maketrust

Use C# to copy resources from one executable, and put them in another one. People have made their own version of this so many times (including myself) it's time it gets uploaded and made permanent. The resources being copied are:
* Icons
* Icon Group
* Version manifest
* Signed certificate

# Usage
Compile this project with VS and run the executable like so
```
maketrust.exe <your_program.exe>
```
